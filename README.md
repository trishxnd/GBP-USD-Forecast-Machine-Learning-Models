# GBP-USD-Forecast-Machine-Learning-Models

## Project Overview

Forex markets are characterised by their volatility and complexity, making it difficult to forecast price movements accurately. Machine learning models are able to parse large amounts of data, identify intricate patterns, and make predictions based on historical data; hence,they have become prevalent tools within the realm of financial forecasting. In this project, I will compare the performance of random forest, artificial neural network, and support vector machine models when it comes to forecasting price movement and whether they can outperform the buy-and-hold return through the use of a backtesting environment (Backtesting.py).
